    + Subsea
    + Offshore
    + Onshore
* 21 vessels (+ 6 in construction)
* 38,000 people in 48 countries (2014)

## Common Risk in the Energy Industry



## The Resource-based View (RBV)

* The RBV is a management theory that shows that a firm can be defined as a set of resources
* A resource can be any strength or weakness of the firm
* Tangible
    + Capital, labor, machinery, natural resources
* Intangible (capability)
    + Brand, technology, education, skill
* In project management, if an organization is defined as a set of resources, then, logically, any part of such an organization, such as projects, is a subset of resources

## The Resource-based Project Risk Analysis Approach

* One way of thinking about project risk is in terms of the uncertainty associated with the expenditure of resources
* Risk may lead to either
    + Additional resource required to complete a task (e.g. engineering rework)
    + Additional cost of acquiring resources (e.g. engineering manhours)
* In fact, the impact of all risk events may be linked to some project or organizational resource impact
* This approach is a natural bridge between the RBV theory and project risk management

## Causal Networks for Project Risk Analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(bnlearn)
library(networkD3)
data <- matrix(NA, ncol = 14)
dag <- model2network("[Cause-Delays on other project][Cause-Install scheduled during hurricane season][Risk-vessel delayed on other project|Cause-Delays on other project][Risk-Inclement weather|Cause-Install scheduled during hurricane season][Resource-Transport vessel rate][Resource-2 transport vessels|Risk-Inclement weather][Resource-1 install vessel|Risk-Inclement weather][Resource-Install vessel rate|Risk-vessel delayed on other project][Resource-25 HUC personnel][Resource-HUC personnel rate][Task-Jacket, topsides, pile tow|Resource-Transport vessel rate:Resource-2 transport vessels][Task-Offshore install|Resource-Transport vessel rate:Resource-2 transport vessels:Resource-Install vessel rate:Resource-1 install vessel][Task-HUC|Resource-HUC personnel rate:Resource-25 HUC personnel][Project-Platform install|Task-Jacket, topsides, pile tow:Task-Offshore install:Task-HUC]")
simpleNetwork(data.frame(arcs(dag)), Source = "from", Target = "to",
                  linkDistance = 100, charge = -400, fontSize = 12, 
                  opacity = 0.8)
```

## Components for Model Development

## Bayesian Inference

<img src="https://github.com/paulgovan/PRMClass_2016/blob/master/Bayesian.Inference.png?raw=true" height="175px" />

* Bayesian Inference is basically the process of updating beliefs based on *evidence*
* As evidence becomes available, inference allows for updating the model as needed
* Inference also serves as a type of what if or scenario analysis (e.g. evaluation of different contract strategies)

## Bayesian Learning

<img src="https://github.com/paulgovan/PRMClass_2016/blob/master/Bayesian.Learning.png?raw=true" height="300px" />

* Bayesian learning is a branch of machine learning that is based on Bayesian statistical models
* Learning is basically the process of combining beliefs with *observed data*
* Adding data to the model generally leads to more precise estimates of the model parameters

## Network Measures for Project Risk Analysis

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(d3heatmap)
d3heatmap(amat(dag), dendrogram = "both", symm = TRUE, 
                cexRow = 0.7, cexCol = 0.7, colors = "Blues")
```

## Key Implications for the Energy Industry

* The resource-based risk analysis approach provides a common language for describing risk in terms of resources that translates across industry segments
* This approach is dynamic in that the model can grow and improve over time as new or better information becomes available over the course of the project
* The application of network measures helps to identify things like critical resources and tasks on the project (e.g. resources that are highly interconnected due to risk)
* The resource-based risk formulation provides a method to estimate correlations among tasks in support of Monte Carlo simulation analysis

## Summary and Conclusions

* The risk network modeling and analysis approach described here provides a common framework for modeling and assessing project risk in terms of the uncertainty associated with the expenditure of resources
* This framework is applicable acrosss different functions of the organization and at different hierarchical levels for task, project, and organizational decision-making
* The integrative risk network approach allows for both graphical structural and data-intensive evaluation of project risks
* Another key aspect of this approach is that it is already integrated with a number of methods already used in industry practice with little to no additional requirements
